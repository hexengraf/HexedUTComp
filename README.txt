UTCompOmni - Omnipotents version of UTComp 

Server installation

Copy these folders to the UT2004 folder:

Sounds\
StaticMeshes\
Textures\
System\


The original UTComp help file is in the Help\ folder

Snarf's recommended settings for Omnipotents 2.0 server are in the UT2004.ini file.  
Copy all contents of this file to the bottom of the server's UT2004.ini file.

Clients/players can hit F5 during gameplay to set their own settings (turn off hit sounds, change brightskins, etc).


A list of ignored hit sounds is also in the UT2004.ini file.

To add more sounds to ignore, add a new line with the damage type of the sound to ignore, e.g.

IgnoredHitSounds=FireKill
IgnoredHitSounds=DamTypeChargingBeam    


This would ignore the fire burning of firetank and beam weapon of the hell bender.

   bEnableWhitelist=False
   WhitelistBanMessage=Not allowed.  Contact the server administrator to gain access

If 'bEnableWhitelist' is true, white list GUI is enabled.  Admins will see a new Admin button in UTComp F5 menu.  Admins can turn on/off the whitelist.  Default is false.

If 'bUseWhitelist' is true, white list is enabled.  Only players with matching PlayerIDs are allowed into the game.  Default is false.

Banned players will see an auto kicked message when they try to join the server.  Change WhitelistBanMessage accordingly.  

The white list is an ini file called 'UTComp_Whitelist.ini' in the System folder.  

[UTCompOmni.UTComp_Whitelist]
WhitelistEntry=PlayerID1
WhitelistEntry=PlayerID2
WhitelistEntry=PlayerID3
etc...

To use SetPreferredExit, you'll need to bind a key to it and combine with the use command, e.g.

in User.ini - 
Q=SetPreferredExit Left 1 | Use
E=SetPreferredExit Right 1 | Use

This would make 'E' exit to the right and 'Q' exit to the left.

Vehicle radar colors can be configured in UTCompOmni.ini file

Here are the defaults:

[UTCompOmni.UTComp_ONSHudOnslaught]
VehicleData=(Name="Minotaur",RadarColor=(B=255,G=255,R=255,A=255))
VehicleData=(Name="Omnitaur",RadarColor=(B=255,G=255,R=255,A=255))

- Make minotaur, omnitaur and badgertaur minimap color white so they stand out
- Add new config value NewNetUpdateFrequency, this is the frequency of the new net code update rate, the default is 200.  Lowering this value may help with lag issues.  It may also throw off the aim calculation? (untested)
